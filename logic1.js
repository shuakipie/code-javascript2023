In JavaScript, array literals are a concise way to create and initialize an array. An array literal is a list of values enclosed in square brackets ([]). Each value in the list is called an element, and elements are separated by commas.

Here is an example of an array literal that creates an array of strings:

let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
You can also use array literals to create an array of numbers:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Or an array of objects:

let objects = [{id: 1, name: 'Alice'}, {id: 2, name: 'Bob'}];
You can even mix and match different types of elements in the same array:

let mixed = [1, 'two', {three: 3}, [4, 5, 6]];
Array literals are a convenient and concise way to create and initialize an array in JavaScript. They can make your code more readable and easier to write.
