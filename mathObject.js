The Math object in JavaScript is a built-in object that provides properties and methods for performing mathematical operations. Here are some examples of using the Math object in JavaScript:

Generating a random number:

let randomNumber = Math.random();
Rounding a number up to the nearest integer:

let x = 1.5;
let y = Math.ceil(x); // y is 2
Rounding a number down to the nearest integer:

let x = 1.5;
let y = Math.floor(x); // y is 1
Calculating the square root of a number:

let x = 16;
let y = Math.sqrt(x); // y is 4
Calculating the absolute value of a number:

let x = -10;
let y = Math.abs(x); // y is 10
Calculating the sine of an angle:

let x = Math.PI / 2;
let y = Math.sin(x); // y is 1
These are just a few examples of the properties and methods available on the Math object. For a complete list, you can refer to the documentation for the Math object in JavaScript.

Calculating the cosine of an angle:

let x = Math.PI;
let y = Math.cos(x); // y is -1
Calculating the logarithm of a number:

let x = Math.E;
let y = Math.log(x); // y is 1
Calculating the maximum of a list of numbers:

let x = Math.max(1, 2, 3); // x is 3
Calculating the minimum of a list of numbers:

let x = Math.min(1, 2, 3); // x is 1
Generating a random integer within a specific range:

let min = 1;
let max = 10;
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
These are just a few more examples of using the Math object in JavaScript. You can find a complete list of properties and methods available on the Math object in the documentation.
